# Face recognition attendance system

we have a face detection attendance system project
on home page we have a title "24-Hour Face Detection Attendance System Challenge. on the same page we also have a button called "mark your attendance. on clicking it camera opens which takes your multiple images as data and stores in a database then it matches it for previously saved faces. If it matches then that attendance will be marked with date time and a sample photo. Now for new users we have a button called "New User Registration" which also opens camera in another tab which takes images as inputs and trains it. we have used html css and javascript for front-end and FastAPI, OpenCV, for backend.






## Deployment

Till now it is locally hosted. Future plans include hosting on Vercel and Heroku, and portable loacl solutions might include Raspbery Pi.
